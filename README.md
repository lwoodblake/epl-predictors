# epl-predictors

This Jupyter Notebook is a piece of work investigating the correlation between: 

* Expected goals (xG): the sum of xG from all goalscoring opportunities in a season
* Expected goals against (xGA): the sum of xG that opponents accumulated from goalscoring opportunities against the club
* Goals for (GF): the number of goals a club scored in a season
* Goals against (GA): the number of goals a club conceded in a season

& a Premier League club's points total in a season.
